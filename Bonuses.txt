Firstly, to make some EDA on the datasets, some details which ordered below caught my attention:

+Has not credit in default more tend to your product.
+Has not housing loan and personal loan also more tend to your product.
+Although there are a bit contrast, less contact during campaign make taking more attention about product.
+More contact duration effect the interesting of product positively.
+Single people more choose the product rather than the other marital status.
+More education leads more interest for the product.
+Students and retired people also more tends to your product. However, when disturbiton with age and 
interest rate of your product.Excluding 26<(supposing student) 60>(supposing retired), 
there are a top point of interest ratio of the product 32-35 year olds. The interest reducing with increasing age or decreasing age.

Secondly, the date and duration time is more important according my observation. Nearly their scaled coeffient sum is exceed 0.9.
Especially datetime can be represent with various feature like is there holiday.It will provide more relation with the targets.
